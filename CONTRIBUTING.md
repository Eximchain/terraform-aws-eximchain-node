The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to this repository and other projects managed by Eximchain, which are hosted in the [Eximchain Organization](https://github.com/eximchain) on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.
