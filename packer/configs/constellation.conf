##   - off: Mutually authenticated TLS is not used for in- and outbound
##     connections, although unauthenticated connections to HTTPS hosts are

##     mechanism like WireGuard is in place.

##     This mode will not add any new clients to the tlsknownclients file.
##
##   - tofu: (Trust-on-first-use) Only the first node that connects identifying
##     as a certain host will be allowed to connect as the same host in the
##     future. Note that nodes identifying as other hosts will still be able
##     to connect -- switch to whitelist after populating the tlsknownclients
##     list to restrict access.
##
##   - ca: Only nodes with a valid certificate and chain of trust to one of
##     the system root certificates will be allowed to connect. The folder
##     containing trusted root certificates can be overriden with the
##     SYSTEM_CERTIFICATE_PATH environment variable.
##
##   - ca-or-tofu: A combination of ca and tofu: If a certificate is valid,
##     it is always allowed and added to the tlsknownclients list. If it is
##     self-signed, it will be allowed only if it's the first certificate this

## Options:
##
##   - whitelist: This node will only connect to servers it has previously seen
##     and added to the tlsknownclients file below. This mode will not add
##     any new servers to the tlsknownservers file.
##
##   - tofu: (Trust-on-first-use) This node will only connect to the same

##
##   - ca: The node will only connect to servers with a valid certificate and
